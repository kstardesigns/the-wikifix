To do:
- rewrite rest of sources as a function

- dim overlay when mobile menu is open (or bigger box shadow under menu)
- make an easier way to put pics in facts (variables?)  "bla bla blah" + factpicopen + "picname.jpg" + factpicclose + "bla bla blah"
- start an array of date-based facts so I can make sure theyre updated. referencing 2014, 2015, 2016, 15, 14, etc
- fix mobile/desktop speed. testwithgoogle
- show press down on touch
- make a 404 page
- higher quality wiki logos in menu/header
- figure out how to show hover images on mobile (max width, etc)
- compliant in other browsers,
- move js that's in html, into js file
- change javascript (when possible) to jquery (ie: document.getElementById("total").innerHTML=factsList.length; )

Later:
- add finger press on button click. maybe swipe somewhere (changing filters)
- apple touch icons, other stuff to make it fully done like kstar
- function to auto count facts with images
- more automation........ !
